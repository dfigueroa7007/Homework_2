# Homework_2
This is the repo for my 2nd homework assignment

In this project I created a base for a portfolio I plan on working on as we progress through this class.

The About section was desgined to have a starter layout for basic information one would like to know about me. Similar to like a linked in main profile page. In the works...

The Portfolio section will be updated with certain projects I complete with brief descriptions on why I wanted to do said project. In the works...

The contact section will provide the means to contact me should anyone decide to. In the works...

Challenges currently being debugged:
- At the present moment I am having issues with the image area in the About section as I have been unable to center it.

The overall layout is a basic foundation to build on and I intend on polishing this further.

Thank you for your time!
